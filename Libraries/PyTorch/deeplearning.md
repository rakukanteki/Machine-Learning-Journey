# Why Deep Learning is good for?
- Problems with long lists of rules.
- Continually changing environment. Deep learning can adapt to new scenarios.
- Discovering insights within large collections of data.

# ML vs DL:
- ML is good for structured data. DL is good for unstructured data.
- some ML algorithms are Random Forest, Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Kth Nearest        
  Neighbors.
- some DL algorithms are Neural Networks, Fully Connected Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural  
  Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Transformer.

# About Neural Networks:
### How does Neural Network work:
- Given inputs -> Convert into numbers -> Choosing good neural network for the problem -> Turns   
  into nodes(like graphs) -> Representation output in numbers -> Output
### Anatomy of Neural Network:
- Input layer -> Hidden layer(s), learns patterns in data -> Output layer(s)

# Types of learning:
1. Supervised Learning.
2. Unsupervised and Self-supervised Learning.
3. Transfer Learning.
4. Reinforcement Learning.

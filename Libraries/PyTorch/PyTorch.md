# About PyTorch:
- Most popular deep learning research framework.
- Write fast deep learning code in Python.
- Can access many pre-built deep learning model.
- Preprocess data, model data, deploy model in application/cloud.

# GPU / TPU:
### GPU:
- Graphics Processing Unit. It needs to render graphics a lot of numerical calculations and numbers.
  PyTorch leverages the GPU through interface CUDA(API).
### TPU:
- Tensor Processing Unit. A Tensor can be any representation of multi-dimensional array numerical
  values that describes the physical state of an objects.

# Topics covered:
1. PyTorch Basics and Fundamentals.
2. Preprocessing data.
3. Building and using pretrained deep learning models.
4. Fitting a model to the data.
5. Making predictions with a model.
6. Evaluation of a model.
7. Saving and loading models.
8. Using a trained model to make predictions on custom data.
